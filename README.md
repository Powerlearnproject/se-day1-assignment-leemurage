Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

  - Software engineering is the art and science of developing significant software 
    systems using well defined scientific principles methods and procedures.

  - Enables innovation and digital transformation:-This is achieved by the 
    facilitation of automation,artificial intelligence and other emerging 
    technologies.

  - Enhances efficiency and productivity:-Automation of repetitive tasks boosts 
    productivity and reduces human error.

  - Strengthens other fields:-Software engineering strengthens other fields such 
    as cybersecurity by ensuring the safety of online transactions and user 
    information

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  -The birth of software engineering:Projects were failing due to poor planning  
   and lack of structured development process.The waterfall model was introduced 
   providing a step by step approach to software development.

  -The rise of object oriented programming:-Object oriented programming was introduced to umprove software modularity
   and languages like C++ were introduced.

  -The Agile and DevOps Revolution:Iterative development,customer collaboartion and flexibility were introduced thereby
  replacing rigid waterfall models while DevOps emerged ,integrating software development with IT operations ensuring faster 
  delivery and continuous integration.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
  -Planning:-Done to define project goals,scope and feasibility.

  -Requirement analysis:-This is done to gather functional and non functional requirements.

  -Design:-This is done to create software architecture,design and database structure. 

  -Implementaion:-The actual code is written based on the design specifications.

  -Testing:-Unit integration,system and user acceptance operations are performed.

  -Deployment:-The software is released for users tomonitor system performance and resolve initial issues.

  -Maintenance and updates:-Bug fixes and perfomance improvements are done,new  software updates are released and new features are added. 
 
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.

 -Waterfall model follows a linear approach, where each phase is completed before moving to the next while agile methodology use an iterative and incremental approach breaking the 
  project into smaller cycles that allows continous development and improvement.
  
 -Flexibility:-In waterfall model once a phase is completed,it is difficult to go back and make changes,while agile is highly flexible allowing teams to adapt to changes and ncoporate 
  feedback throughout the development process.
  
 -Develoopment process:-In waterfall model,development progresses step by step and testing only occurs after coding is complete while in agile methodologies, development and testing take 
  place in  each phase ensuring continuous feeedback and improvements.

 -Testing:-Testing in the waterfall model happens at the end of the development cycle,which may lead to  late detection of bugs while in agile,testing is an ongoing process within each 
  sprint leading to higher resolution. 
  
 -Risk management:-Waterfall carries higher risk if requirements change mid project because modifications can be costly and time consuming while agile reduces risks by allowing changes 
  at any stage,making it ideal for evolving requirements. 

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
