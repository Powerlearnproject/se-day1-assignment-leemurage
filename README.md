# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

  - Software engineering is the art and science of developing significant software 
    systems using well defined scientific principles methods and procedures.

  - Enables innovation and digital transformation:-This is achieved by the 
    facilitation of automation,artificial intelligence and other emerging 
    technologies.

  - Enhances efficiency and productivity:-Automation of repetitive tasks boosts 
    productivity and reduces human error.

  - Strengthens other fields:-Software engineering strengthens other fields such 
    as cybersecurity by ensuring the safety of online transactions and user 
    information

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
  -The birth of software engineering:Projects were failing due to poor planning  
   and lack of structured development process.The waterfall model was introduced 
   providing a step by step approach to software development.

  -The rise of object oriented programming:


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
